# ElderHelper-frontend
# Introduction
  Elder Helper is a mobile application that enables Elders and Helpers to use the app in different ways by accessing different user interfaces. The elders are able to log in to post jobs that they need doing or need help with. The helpers can log in and see which jobs are in their area and accept them if suitable. In times where many people can feel isolated and alone, Elder Helper promotes connection in the community and a space for people to meet safely and do a good deed!

We used React Native and React Native Maps using a Google Maps API for the "Helper" user interface.
